This is some sample codes for the HappyDjango class in OSSF(Open Source Software Foundry) on 2010/8/21 & 22

Project Name:
happydjango

Environment:
ubuntu 10.04
python 2.6.5
django 1.2.1

Features:
*Member:
-create account
-account login / logout

*BookStore:
-list
-view

*admin site
-build the CRUD function for the BookStore with Admin module

Install:
1. get the source code and extract the file if needed.
2. REMEMBER to change the default directory name "HappyDjango" to "happydjango"
3. run "python manage.py syncdb" under the extracted source directory, 
   it should create the database(sqlite3) for you at the first time, 
   and ask you some questions for creating the admin site, such as login 
   id and login password, just answer those questions as you wish :)
4. run "python manage.py runserver" to launch the internal python web 
   server on 127.0.0.1 with port 8000, and you can login the admin site 
   with login id and password that you just created at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin, 
   of course you can change the ip address and the port number if you want.
